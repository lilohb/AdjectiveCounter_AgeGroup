# Term-paper

This repository will house your submission for the final term paper/project for the course. Details on the requirements are outlined [here](https://spencercaplan.org/teaching/F24/Comp-Methods-I/termpaper.html)

Simply push the paper/code/data to this repo ahead of the semester deadline **and also** send me (Spencer) an email once you've done so and you're ready for me to grade your submission.
